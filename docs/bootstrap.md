# Install Fwk\Core

If you don't have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) yet, download it or just run the following command:

``` sh
$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
``` 

Then you can use the ```create-project``` command to generate a new skeleton for your application:

``` sh
$ php composer.phar create-project fwk/skeleton path/to/install --prefer-dist --dev dev-master
``` 

Please note that this skeleton is just _one_ way to organize your Fwk\Core application. Feel free to reorganize things as you wish!

## What now?
